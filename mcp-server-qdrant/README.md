# MCP Server for Qdrant Context Retrieval

> **Note:** This service is part of the unified `mcp-servers` repository. 
> It is recommended to build and run this service using the top-level Dockerfile 
> located in the root of the `mcp-servers` repository.
> See the [main README](../../README.md) for instructions.

This repository contains an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server designed to retrieve context from a [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) vector database. It allows language models or other agents to query Qdrant for relevant documents based on a text query.

## Overview

The server implements the MCP specification, exposing tools that can be discovered and called by MCP clients. The primary tool allows querying a Qdrant collection using a specified embedding model.

## Features

*   **MCP Compliance:** Implements `list_tools` and `call_tool` endpoints.
*   **Qdrant Integration:** Connects to a Qdrant instance to perform vector searches.
*   **Configurable Embedding Model:** Uses FastEmbed to generate query embeddings. The model can be configured via environment variables.
*   **SSE Transport:** Uses Server-Sent Events for communication.
*   **Dockerized:** Includes a Dockerfile for easy deployment (though superseded by the top-level Dockerfile).

## Environment Variables

Configuration is primarily done through environment variables. See the top-level `.env.example` file in the `mcp-servers` root directory for the full list.

Key variables include:

*   `QDRANT_URL`: The URL of your Qdrant instance (e.g., `http://localhost:6333`).
*   `QDRANT_API_KEY`: API key for Qdrant Cloud or secured instances (optional).
*   `COLLECTION_NAME`: The name of the Qdrant collection to query.
*   `EMBEDDING_MODEL`: The name of the FastEmbed model to use (e.g., `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).

## Tools Exposed

### `retrieve_context_from_qdrant`

*   **Description:** Retrieves relevant documents from a configured Qdrant collection based on a query.
*   **Input Schema (`QdrantContextRetrievalRequest`):
    *   `query` (string, required): The text query to search for.
    *   `limit` (integer, default: 5): The maximum number of documents to retrieve.
    *   `score_threshold` (float, optional): Minimum similarity score for retrieved documents.
*   **Output:** A list of `TextContent` objects, each containing the text content of a retrieved document.

## Running Locally (Development Only)

While the unified Docker container is the recommended method, you can run this server locally for development:

1.  **Navigate to the `mcp-servers` root directory.**
2.  **Ensure `uv` is installed.**
3.  **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate # Or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies (from the root):**
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```
5.  **Set environment variables:** Export `QDRANT_URL`, `COLLECTION_NAME`, etc.
6.  **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    mcp-server-qdrant --transport sse --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```
    *(Adjust host/port as needed)*

## Installation

### Using uvx

When using [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/#running-tools) no specific installation is needed to directly run *mcp-server-qdrant*.

```shell
QDRANT_URL="http://localhost:6333" \
COLLECTION_NAME="my-collection" \
EMBEDDING_MODEL="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" \
uvx mcp-server-qdrant
```

#### Transport Protocols

The server supports different transport protocols that can be specified using the `--transport` flag:

```shell
QDRANT_URL="http://localhost:6333" \
COLLECTION_NAME="my-collection" \
uvx mcp-server-qdrant --transport sse
```

Supported transport protocols:

- `stdio` (default): Standard input/output transport, might only be used by local MCP clients
- `sse`: Server-Sent Events transport, perfect for remote clients

The default transport is `stdio` if not specified.

### Using Docker

A Dockerfile is available for building and running the MCP server:

```bash
# Build the container
docker build -t mcp-server-qdrant .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -e QDRANT_URL="http://your-qdrant-server:6333" \
  -e QDRANT_API_KEY="your-api-key" \
  -e COLLECTION_NAME="your-collection" \
  mcp-server-qdrant
```

### Installing via Smithery

To install Qdrant MCP Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/protocol/mcp-server-qdrant):

```bash
npx @smithery/cli install mcp-server-qdrant --client claude
```

### Manual configuration of Claude Desktop

To use this server with the Claude Desktop app, add the following configuration to the "mcpServers" section of your
`claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "qdrant": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": ["mcp-server-qdrant"],
    "env": {
      "QDRANT_URL": "https://xyz-example.eu-central.aws.cloud.qdrant.io:6333",
      "QDRANT_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
      "COLLECTION_NAME": "your-collection-name",
      "EMBEDDING_MODEL": "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
    }
  }
}
```

For local Qdrant mode:

```json
{
  "qdrant": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": ["mcp-server-qdrant"],
    "env": {
      "QDRANT_LOCAL_PATH": "/path/to/qdrant/database",
      "COLLECTION_NAME": "your-collection-name",
      "EMBEDDING_MODEL": "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
    }
  }
}
```

This MCP server will automatically create a collection with the specified name if it doesn't exist.

By default, the server will use the `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embedding model to encode memories.
For the time being, only [FastEmbed](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/) models are supported.

## Support for other tools

This MCP server can be used with any MCP-compatible client. For example, you can use it with
[Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs), which provide built-in support for the Model Context
Protocol.

### Using with Cursor/Windsurf

You can configure this MCP server to work as a code search tool for Cursor or Windsurf by customizing the tool
descriptions:

```bash
QDRANT_URL="http://localhost:6333" \
COLLECTION_NAME="code-snippets" \
TOOL_STORE_DESCRIPTION="Store reusable code snippets for later retrieval. \
The 'information' parameter should contain a natural language description of what the code does, \
while the actual code should be included in the 'metadata' parameter as a 'code' property. \
The value of 'metadata' is a Python dictionary with strings as keys. \
Use this whenever you generate some code snippet." \
TOOL_FIND_DESCRIPTION="Search for relevant code snippets based on natural language descriptions. \
The 'query' parameter should describe what you're looking for, \
and the tool will return the most relevant code snippets. \
Use this when you need to find existing code snippets for reuse or reference." \
uvx mcp-server-qdrant --transport sse # Enable SSE transport
```

In Cursor/Windsurf, you can then configure the MCP server in your settings by pointing to this running server using
SSE transport protocol. The description on how to add an MCP server to Cursor can be found in the [Cursor
documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#adding-an-mcp-server-to-cursor). If you are
running Cursor/Windsurf locally, you can use the following URL:

```
http://localhost:8000/sse
```

> [!TIP]
> We suggest SSE transport as a preferred way to connect Cursor/Windsurf to the MCP server, as it can support remote
> connections. That makes it easy to share the server with your team or use it in a cloud environment.

This configuration transforms the Qdrant MCP server into a specialized code search tool that can:

1. Store code snippets, documentation, and implementation details
2. Retrieve relevant code examples based on semantic search
3. Help developers find specific implementations or usage patterns

You can populate the database by storing natural language descriptions of code snippets (in the `information` parameter)
along with the actual code (in the `metadata.code` property), and then search for them using natural language queries
that describe what you're looking for.

> [!NOTE]
> The tool descriptions provided above are examples and may need to be customized for your specific use case. Consider
> adjusting the descriptions to better match your team's workflow and the specific types of code snippets you want to
> store and retrieve.

**If you have successfully installed the `mcp-server-qdrant`, but still can't get it to work with Cursor, please
consider creating the [Cursor rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai) so the MCP tools are always used when
the agent produces a new code snippet.** You can restrict the rules to only work for certain file types, to avoid using
the MCP server for the documentation or other types of content.

### Using with Claude Code

You can enhance Claude Code's capabilities by connecting it to this MCP server, enabling semantic search over your
existing codebase.

#### Setting up mcp-server-qdrant

1. Add the MCP server to Claude Code:

    ```shell
    # Add mcp-server-qdrant configured for code search
    claude mcp add code-search \
    -e QDRANT_URL="http://localhost:6333" \
    -e COLLECTION_NAME="code-repository" \
    -e EMBEDDING_MODEL="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" \
    -e TOOL_STORE_DESCRIPTION="Store code snippets with descriptions. The 'information' parameter should contain a natural language description of what the code does, while the actual code should be included in the 'metadata' parameter as a 'code' property." \
    -e TOOL_FIND_DESCRIPTION="Search for relevant code snippets using natural language. The 'query' parameter should describe the functionality you're looking for." \
    -- uvx mcp-server-qdrant
    ```

2. Verify the server was added:

    ```shell
    claude mcp list
    ```

#### Using Semantic Code Search in Claude Code

Tool descriptions, specified in `TOOL_STORE_DESCRIPTION` and `TOOL_FIND_DESCRIPTION`, guide Claude Code on how to use
the MCP server. The ones provided above are examples and may need to be customized for your specific use case. However,
Claude Code should be already able to:

1. Use the `qdrant-store` tool to store code snippets with descriptions.
2. Use the `qdrant-find` tool to search for relevant code snippets using natural language.

### Run MCP server in Development Mode

The MCP server can be run in development mode using the `mcp dev` command. This will start the server and open the MCP
inspector in your browser.

```shell
COLLECTION_NAME=mcp-dev mcp dev src/mcp_server_qdrant/server.py
```

#### Manual Installation

Add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "qdrantUrl",
        "description": "Qdrant URL"
      },
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "qdrantApiKey",
        "description": "Qdrant API Key",
        "password": true
      },
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "collectionName",
        "description": "Collection Name"
      }
    ],
    "servers": {
      "qdrant": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["mcp-server-qdrant"],
        "env": {
          "QDRANT_URL": "${input:qdrantUrl}",
          "QDRANT_API_KEY": "${input:qdrantApiKey}",
          "COLLECTION_NAME": "${input:collectionName}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or if you prefer using Docker, add this configuration instead:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "qdrantUrl",
        "description": "Qdrant URL"
      },
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "qdrantApiKey",
        "description": "Qdrant API Key",
        "password": true
      },
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "collectionName",
        "description": "Collection Name"
      }
    ],
    "servers": {
      "qdrant": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "-p", "8000:8000",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "-e", "QDRANT_URL",
          "-e", "QDRANT_API_KEY",
          "-e", "COLLECTION_NAME",
          "mcp-server-qdrant"
        ],
        "env": {
          "QDRANT_URL": "${input:qdrantUrl}",
          "QDRANT_API_KEY": "${input:qdrantApiKey}",
          "COLLECTION_NAME": "${input:collectionName}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace with the following content:

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "qdrantUrl",
      "description": "Qdrant URL"
    },
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "qdrantApiKey",
      "description": "Qdrant API Key",
      "password": true
    },
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "collectionName",
      "description": "Collection Name"
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "qdrant": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-qdrant"],
      "env": {
        "QDRANT_URL": "${input:qdrantUrl}",
        "QDRANT_API_KEY": "${input:qdrantApiKey}",
        "COLLECTION_NAME": "${input:collectionName}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For workspace configuration with Docker, use this in `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "qdrantUrl",
      "description": "Qdrant URL"
    },
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "qdrantApiKey",
      "description": "Qdrant API Key",
      "password": true
    },
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "collectionName",
      "description": "Collection Name"
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "qdrant": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-p", "8000:8000",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e", "QDRANT_URL",
        "-e", "QDRANT_API_KEY",
        "-e", "COLLECTION_NAME",
        "mcp-server-qdrant"
      ],
      "env": {
        "QDRANT_URL": "${input:qdrantUrl}",
        "QDRANT_API_KEY": "${input:qdrantApiKey}",
        "COLLECTION_NAME": "${input:collectionName}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The [MCP inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) is a developer tool for testing and debugging MCP
servers. It runs both a client UI (default port 5173) and an MCP proxy server (default port 3000). Open the client UI in
your browser to use the inspector.

```shell
QDRANT_URL=":memory:" COLLECTION_NAME="test" \
mcp dev src/mcp_server_qdrant/server.py
```

Once started, open your browser to http://localhost:5173 to access the inspector interface.
